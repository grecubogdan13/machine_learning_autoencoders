# machine_learning_autoencoders
Implemented filters to remove low temporal frequencies from an audio file
Implemented filter to find vertical edges in an image
Implement a function that greatly modifies the input image, while retaining the same output as the original when doing vertical edge detection

Implemented a denoising filter, using a 5x5 Gaussian Kernel.
Implemented a pyramidal encoder-decoder to denoise of image
Compared the results obtained by the methods
Constructed a FGSM attack in order to modify one image from the training set such that it still follows the distribution of the training set, but that has poor results when passed through the autoencoder denoiser

Implemented a convolutional AutoEncoder
Implemented a variational AutoEncoder
